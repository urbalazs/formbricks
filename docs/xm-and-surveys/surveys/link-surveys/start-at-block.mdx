The `startAt` URL parameter lets you open a Link Survey at a specific **block** instead of from the beginning. This is useful when you want to link to a specific part of the survey from external sources or reuse the same survey at different points in the user journey.

## How it works

The survey navigation is block-based: each block can contain one or more questions. When you pass `startAt` with a Question ID, the survey finds the **block** that contains that question and opens at that block. All questions in that block are shown together.

<Note>
  **Multi-question blocks:** When a block has multiple questions, `startAt` opens at the block—you will see all questions in that block, not only the question whose ID you used. For precise "start at this exact question" behavior, use one question per block.
</Note>

## How to use it

1. In the Survey Editor, open the Questions Tab and ensure the survey is set as a **Link Survey**.

2. Find the question (or block) you want to start at, click on **Show Advanced Settings**, and copy the **Question ID** of any question in that block.

<Note>
  Each question has a unique Question ID. Since `startAt` resolves to the block containing the question, you can use any question ID from the target block—typically the first question in that block.
</Note>

3. Append `?startAt=question_id` to your survey's URL, replacing `question_id` with the copied Question ID.

4. Share this modified URL with your users to start the survey at the specified block.

## Use cases

- **Link to a specific block from an external source:** Direct users to a specific block in your survey from emails, chatbots, or web pages.
- **Use the same survey in different parts of the user journey:** Reuse the survey at different stages, starting at different blocks to gather insights.
- **Create a personalized survey experience:** Tailor the survey by starting at a particular block based on the user's past interactions or preferences.
